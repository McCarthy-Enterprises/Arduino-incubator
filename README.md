One of our electrical engeeners decided to make this so use it I guess. Btw i don't know if this really works so modify it and make pull requests if you think you can inprove it

## You will need
+ Arduino (uno and nano)
+ Relay or transistor to control the heating bulb
+ Halogen, incandescent or inferred heating bulb
+ Insulated box to trap the heat but also some holes to let oxygen flow through.
+ DHT 11 temputure or humidity sensor
+ 2 green leds, 1 blue and 1 red
+ 4 220 ohm resistors 
+ 12v power source
